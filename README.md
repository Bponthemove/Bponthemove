Hello, I am Bram. 

I have been on a journey to transition into front end development since last year. I chose to do it the self-taught way, because of family and being able to carry on to work. I come from absolute zero, no coding experience whatsoever. I think however that a lot of skills from my previous careers are transferable.

I love building with React/Next.js, using css with sass or styled component. Creativity combined with problem-solving is what keeps me coming back for more.

I am very interested in clean tech, sustainability and balanced societies and I am hoping to one day contribute to something amazing that will have a big impact on our futures. I love technology that reaches out to many and helps in a positive way.

I love to contribute to projects to improve my own skills and to understand more about work flow between developers and (if possible) to help others.
I leave all my old repo's on here, to show the journey I have been through, no matter what the code looks like.

Please feel free to contact me about contributions, feedback, etc!
