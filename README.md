Hello, I am Bram. 

I have been on a journey to transition into front end development since last year. I chose to do it the self-taught way, because of family and being able to carry on to work.
I am very interested in clean tech, sustainability and balanced societies and I am hoping to one day contribute to something amazing that will have an big impact on our futures.

I love to contribute to projects to improve my own skills and to understand more about work flow between developers and (if possible) to help others.

Please feel free to contact me about contributions, feedback, etc!
