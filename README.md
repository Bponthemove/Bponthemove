Hello, I am Bram. 

I have been on a journey to transition into front end development since last year. I chose to do it the self-taught way, because of family and being able to carry on to work.
I come from absolute zero, no coding experience whatsoever. I think however that a lot of skills are transferable. Renovating a bathroom/kitchen is very similar as a thought process. You have to think about the structure, the routes of electrics/plumbing and all the levels and angles, before you start anything. 

I am very interested in clean tech, sustainability and balanced societies and I am hoping to one day contribute to something amazing that will have a big impact on our futures.

I love to contribute to projects to improve my own skills and to understand more about work flow between developers and (if possible) to help others.
I leave all my old repo's on here, to show the journey I have been through, no matter what the code looks like.

Please feel free to contact me about contributions, feedback, etc!

This is my old portfolio, which I built when I was learning about express and mongo. At the moment I am building a new one.
